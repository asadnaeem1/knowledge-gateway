## Some tips that you can keep in mind while writing the blog.

- Use short paragraphs, break down longer paragraphs into smaller one, people lose their interest more while reading a long paragraph

- Use headers to structure your post, use large headers for the main heading and smaller for sub-sections in it

- Try to use complete words then abbreviations, spell out an acronym that isn’t well-known

- Try to use images/screenshots in your post to example things better, images are also visible when you share the post in social media

- Always provide a GitHub demo link whenever you post contains the code.
